			<h2>About me</h2>
			<div class="about-me">
				<p>At just 5 years old Megan challenged herself to read 365 books in a year but finished in just 10 months!
                 She has always been keen to grow her library at home and is a frequent visitor to her local library.  
                 Megan may have read 365 books in 10 months, but she was reading every day before that and has been every day since, 
                 estimating that she is well over the 2500 book-mark and nothing is slowing her down!  
                 She is a keen supporter of literacy and authors alike. Now she is older, Megan reads a little less in quantity,
                 but more substantial literature, lending her reading expertise to help review and educate others in the art of books.</p>

					<p>Megan was one of our very first reviewers back when we first launched in 2016.
						My dream for Toppsta was to create a space where children could recommend books to each other,
						to highlight books that children really loved, not just those books which adults think they
						should be reading.
						It was clear, pretty early on, that not only was Megan a voracious book reader but that she
						wrote really helpful and engaging reviews,
						which appealed to other children. I can’t tell you how much this impressed me
						- given her age - and she has been an enthusiastic and committed reviewer ever since.
						I hope she knows that Toppsta would not be the same without her and every recommendation she
						writes helps other readers.
						I am truly excited to see where Megan’s reading and writing journey takes her.</p>

					<p>Megan is one of my favourite young bloggers, who has a passion and energy for books that is clear when you meet her or read her blogs.
                      I’ve had the pleasure and honour of knowing Megan since quite early on in my career and she’s always my first choice
                      blogger and reviewer when I know I’ve got a new book coming out!</p>

        <h2>Megan's Must Reads</h2>
        <div class="review">
        <h3>Scavengers</h3>
        <p>Darren Simpson</p>
        <p>Landfill has lived his whole life as a scavenger, running with wooflers, swimming with turtles and feasting on fresh gull.
         Old Babagoo has always looked after him, on one condition – follow his rules. Never come looking Outside. Never rise above the wall.
         But despite the dangers, Landfill longs to see Outside. And some rules are made to be broken.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="review">
        <h3>Jinxed</h3>
        <p>Amy McCulloch</p>
        <p>Lacey Chu has big dreams of working for the company behind the 'baku' - a customizable smart pet that functions as a phone
         but makes the perfect companion for its user. The only problem is, she's just been rejected from Profectus Academy
         - the elite academy for cutting-edge tech. 
         Then Lacey meets Jinx... Jinx is an incredibly advanced cat baku who opens up a world that Lacey never new existed,
         including entry into the hallowed halls of Profectus. But what is Jinx, really?
         His abilities far surpass anything written into his coded. He seems to be more than just a robotic pet.</p>

        <div class="review">
        <h3>In the Key of Code</h3>
        <p>Aimee Lucido</p>
        <p>When twelve-year-old Emmy's musical family moves to California so her dad can take a job with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra,
         Emmy has never felt more out of tune. But when she ends up in a school computer science club, 
         she finds that she can understand code through a language she is familiar with: music. 
         Slowly, Emmy makes friends with Abigail and the two girls start to discover their voices through the programming language of Java.</p>
