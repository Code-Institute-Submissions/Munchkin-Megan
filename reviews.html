              <h3 class="scavengers">Scavengers</h3>
              <p>by Darren Simpson</p>
              <p class="blurb">
                Landfill has lived his whole life as a scavenger, running with
                wooflers, swimming with turtles and feasting on fresh gull. Old
                Babagoo has always looked after him, on one condition – follow
                his rules. Never come looking Outside. Never rise above the
                wall. But despite the dangers, Landfill longs to see Outside.
                And some rules are made to be broken.

                <a class="btn btn-sm btn-light" href="">Read Review</a>
                The book is about a boy called Landfill who's lived his whole
                life as a scavenger. He was found as a baby and raised by an old
                man, Babagoo. The story follows Landfill as he makes a friend
                with an 'outsider'. Landfill is very unsure of this friendship
                as he has never experienced anything like it. Wow! What a
                massive emotional rollercoaster ride of a book. I think I pretty
                much cried for the last 2 chapters of the book. I think the last
                4 chapters changed everything for me. There are so many twists
                and turns, and each one is brilliant. This is ridiculously well
                written book and I loved reading every minute of it. I found
                myself frustrated, sad, angry, happy and sometimes all within a
                short space of time. I think the character I most relate to is
                Dawn because she constantly wants to help Landfill, she's very
                caring and adventurous. It completely peaked my curiosity and I
                couldn't put it down. I'd reread it in a heart beat but I just
                need a minute to process everything before I dive back in! That
                ending, was beautiful and sad. The blurb does not do this book
                justice

              <p>by Amy McCulloch</p>
              <p class="blurb">
                Lacey Chu has big dreams of working for the company behind the
                'baku' - a customizable smart pet that functions as a phone but
                makes the perfect companion for its user. The only problem is,
                she's just been rejected from Profectus Academy - the elite
                academy for cutting-edge tech. Then Lacey meets Jinx... Jinx is
                an incredibly advanced cat baku who opens up a world that Lacey
                never new existed, including entry into the hallowed halls of
                Profectus. But what is Jinx, really? His abilities far surpass
                anything written into his coded. He seems to be more than just a
                robotic pet. He seems ... real.

                <a class="btn btn-sm btn-light" href="">Read Review</a> Well, I
                absolutely loved and I mean LOVED, this book! For starters I
                would like to say how gripping this book was, I thought the idea
                of the Bakus was excellent and I genuinely want one! I felt very
                much for Lacey when times were tough, I thought the
                characterisation and development of characters was executed
                brilliantly! Amy did a superb job writing this book, I couldn't
                put it down and whenever I was reading this book I found it
                incredibly immersive, like I was actually there. A mixture of
                sci fi and mystery, this book was a thrilling read from start to
                finish and I look forward whole heartedly to the next one!

              <p>by Aimee Lucido</p>
              <p class="blurb">
                When twelve-year-old Emmy's musical family moves to California
                so her dad can take a job with the San Francisco Symphony
                Orchestra, Emmy has never felt more out of tune. But when she
                ends up in a school computer science club, she finds that she
                can understand code through a language she is familiar with:
                music. Slowly, Emmy makes friends with Abigail and the two girls
                start to discover their voices through the programming language
                of Java. Extraordinarily crafted, the novel begins to
                incorporate Java's syntax and concepts as Emmy, and ultimately
                the reader, learns to think in code. By the end, Emmy doesn't
                feel like a wrong note, but like a musician in the world's most
                beautiful symphony.

                I loved this book. It was just amazing. The book was absolutely
                superb. I adored the layout, it was like reading music or
                poetry. It felt like there was a symphony in my head and i've
                never read anything that has done that before. The story telling
                and the character description was sublime. It is one of the BEST
                books that i have read in a long time. I wanted to read the book
                because i code, i enjoy coding and find it fun so i liked that
                element to the story. BUT i got so much more than i bargained
                for because like i said, it's like you're in the middle of
                symphony or an opera. I feel like i'm selling the story short
                because i enjoyed it so much it's actually hard to put into
                words. I loved it so much i've been telling my Mum to read it to
                so we can talk about it, she says it reminds her a bit of
                Benjamin Zephaniah in the way that it is lyrical, it has a beat
                all of it's own. To sum up, great story and characterisation-
                please write another book! Superb and unique layout and
                structure. I LOVED IT!

                  "Megan was one of our very first reviewers back when we first
                  launched in 2016. My dream for Toppsta was to create a space
                  where children could recommend books to each other, to
                  highlight books that children really loved, not just those
                  books which adults think they should be reading. It was clear,
                  pretty early on, that not only was Megan a voracious book
                  reader but that she wrote really helpful and engaging reviews,
                  which appealed to other children. I can’t tell you how much
                  this impressed me - given her age - and she has been an
                  enthusiastic and committed reviewer ever since. I hope she
                  knows that Toppsta would not be the same without her and every
                  recommendation she writes helps other readers. I am truly
                  excited to see where Megan’s reading and writing journey takes
                  her."<br />

                Megan is one of my favourite young bloggers, who has a passion
                and energy for books that is clear when you meet her or read her
                blogs. I’ve had the pleasure and honour of knowing Megan since
                quite early on in my career and she’s always my first choice
                blogger and reviewer when I know I’ve got a new book coming out!
