						Determined to provide other parents and children with an easier way to find great books,
						Toppsta.com was launched.
						Megan has been a valuable asset to Toppsta, providing nearly two-hundred reviews, with no sign

										highlight books that children really loved, not just those
										books which adults think they should be reading. It was clear,
										pretty early on, that not only was Megan a voracious book
										reader but that she wrote really helpful and engaging reviews,
										which appealed to other children. I can’t tell you how much
										this impressed me - given her age - and she has been an
										enthusiastic and committed reviewer ever since. I hope she
										knows that Toppsta would not be the same without her and every
										recommendation she writes helps other readers. I am truly

										so her dad can take a job with the San Francisco Symphony
										Orchestra, Emmy has never felt more out of tune. But when she

					<p class="review-text">The book is about a boy called Landfill who's lived his whole
						life as a scavenger. He was found as a baby and raised by an old
						man, Babagoo. The story follows Landfill as he makes a friend
						with an 'outsider'. Landfill is very unsure of this friendship
						as he has never experienced anything like it.
					</p>
					<p class="review-text">Wow! What a massive emotional rollercoaster ride of a book. I think I pretty
						much cried for the last two chapters! I think the lastfour chapters changed everything for me.
						There are so many twists and turns, and each one is brilliant. This is ridiculously well
						written book and I loved reading every minute of it.
					</p>
					<p class="review-text">I found myself frustrated, sad, angry, happy and sometimes all within a
						short space of time. I think the character I most relate to is
						Dawn because she constantly wants to help Landfill, she's very
						caring and adventurous. It completely peaked my curiosity and I
						couldn't put it down. I'd reread it in a heart beat but I just
						need a minute to process everything before I dive back in! That
						ending, was beautiful and sad.
						The blurb does not do this book justice

						and the character description was sublime.

					<p class="review-text"> It is one of the BEST
						books that i have read in a long time. I wanted to read the book
						because i code, i enjoy coding and find it fun so i liked that

						for because like i said, it's like you're in the middle of
						symphony or an opera. I feel like i'm selling the story short
						because i enjoyed it so much it's actually hard to put into
						words.
					</p>
					<p class="review-text"> I loved it so much i've been telling my Mum to read it to
						so we can talk about it, she says it reminds her a bit of
						Benjamin Zephaniah in the way that it is lyrical, it has a beat
						all of it's own. To sum up, great story and characterisation-
						please write another book! Superb and unique layout and
						structure. I LOVED IT!
