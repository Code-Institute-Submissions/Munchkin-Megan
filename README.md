# **Munchkin Megan Presents**

[Munchkin Megan Presents](https://bicks79.github.io/Munchkin-Megan/) is the first of three milestone projects I will undertake as Full Stack Developer with the Code Institute. 
The aim of this project is to design and build a static web page, showcasing the skills I have learnt, utilising HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
The aim of my project is to encourage more children to read and to aid parents and teachers in choosing the most engaging and beneficial reading material for their children or class.  
This site is based on my daughter’s own reading experience and her journey through books, showing how incredible the literary world is.  
The site offers an honest look at literacy, book reviews and gives the user potential to investigate other book related avenues. 
Moving forwards, the project will have the ability (by signing up to Megan’s book club) to involve the user in more interactive ways.


## **UX**
The purpose of this project is to present information about books. 
Offering the right information to both new and returning users visiting the site, improves the user experience.
By thinking about why the user would want to visit the site, I asked myself the following questions:

- I'm looking for a place that will get my child interested in books.
- Can I get regular updates and information on what to read or what is coming out soon?
- Can I navigate the site in a way that is familiar to me? 
- How does Megan know so much about books?
- Is her information credible?
- I'm looking for something to read, what do you recommend?
- As a child, I want to find out what other children think about this book. 
- As a teacher, I want something to read to my class, what would keep them invested?
- I need to buy a gift, what would you recommend for his/her age?
- Where can I buy the book?
- Have I found what I'm looking for?
- I want to find out more about Megan, where can I do this?
- I want to ask Megan a question, can I get in touch?

These user stories were the buildng blocks for my project and helped me to create the site from the ground up.
I wanted the site to be easy to navigate across all formats, inviting the user to return again and again for new information. 
It also needed to reflect Megan's personality, showing how books have had such an impact on her life, 
and in return have a positive effect on the user by encouaging them to read. 
  
Since its inception, the project changed in appearance from the original design wireframes (fig.1 below).
I had oroiginally intended to create a resume style page for Megan, based on her reading and writing achievements.
It became apparent quite early on, that the initial design did not fit into the brief as well as I had hoped.

![original wireframes](https://i.imgur.com/mChICh5.jpg)

Changes were required to better fit the brief and so new wireframes (fig.2 below) were created using the content from the originals.
These changes, better suited my user stories and the project became more of a magazine article than a resume.
The new wireframes allowed me to be more creative and build each page more organically. Allowing me to use them as a template,
I could create each page using the a theme, but respond to how the content sat and adjust it accordingly.
Choosing a light, muted colour scheme helped to keep things subtle.  Just like a good book, the content is the star.
The colours in the project help identify breaks in content, and highlight interactive elements of the project such as modals, buttons and menus.
This makes for a good user experience and keeps things uniform.

## **Technologies Used**

#### **HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language)**
- [Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML)](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) is the standard mark-up language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. - Wikipedia 

#### **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**
- [Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a mark-up language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. - Wikipedia

#### **Bootstrap**
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a free and open source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. - Wikipedia

#### **GitHub**
- [GitHub](https://github.com/), is a United States-based global company that provides hosting for software development version control using Git. - Wikipedia

#### **Gitpod**
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/), is open-source IDE (Integrated Development Environment) based on Eclipse Theia.  It is used to create, modify, and save code.

#### **Git** 
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. - Wikipedia
 
#### **Web Development Tools** 
- [Web development tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) (often called dev-tools) allow web developers to test and debug their code. They are different from website builders and integrated development environments (IDEs) in that they do not assist in the direct creation of a webpage, rather they are tools used for testing the user interface of a website or web application. - Wikipedia

#### **W3C Validation**
- [Mark-up Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) is a validator by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that allows Internet users to check HTML and XHTML documents for well-formed mark-up. Mark-up validation is an important step towards ensuring the technical quality of web pages. – Wikipedia

#### **GIMP**
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is a free and open-source raster graphics editor used for image retouching and editing, free-form drawing, converting between different image formats, and more specialized tasks. - Wikipedia


## **Testing**
I used the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check that both my HTML and CSS files contained valid code with no errors.
I had issues with only one file, where in my reviews.html file I had used an anchor tag inside a button element on each of my six review items to take the user to an external purchasing site.
To ensure the code was valid, I removed the button element and relocated the anchor tag so it was more aesthetically pleasing.
When tested again, the code was valid with no errors.
Another issue appeared for the iPhone5/SE, which has difficulty displying full screen width without overflow of the jumbotron and callout. 
This has been resolved as best as possible, by altering the displayed text within the callout, to reduce the obsured text.

I was advised by my mentor to 'fix' the navigation bar to the top of the screen, reducing the scroll time of the user.  
While I respect his opinion, I felt that this threw off the aesthetics of the page and decided to leave the menu 'unfixed'. 

Through Chrome developer tools, each file was tested on multipe viewing platforms. I took advantage of the ability to swap devices and see how each layout would look on different platforms.  
The project was responsive, with all links and functions responding in an accepatble time frame. 
IE and Edge were the only exception, where loading times were slower than Chrome and Safari, resulting in a negative experience for the user.
Due to issues with installtion on my machine, this project has not been tested on Opera, and will require testing to ensure full cross browser functionallity. 

From feedback through family members and a small select group of willing testers, the site looks most appealing on mobile devices and iPad, with the iPad display being particularly attractive.
