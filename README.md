# **Munchkin Megan Presents**

This is the first of three milestone projects I will undertake as Full Stack Developer with the Code Institute. 
The aim of this project is to design and build a static web page, showcasing the skills I have learnt so far on the course, utilising HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
The aim of my project is to encourage more children to read and to aid parents/teachers in choosing the most engaging and beneficial reading material for their children/class.  
This site is based on my daughter’s own experience with reading and her journey through books, showing how incredible the literary world is.  
The site offers honest book reviews and gives the user potential to explore other book related websites. 
Moving forwards, the project will have the ability (by signing up to Megan’s book club) to include the latest reviews and interviews with authors, illustrators, and publishers, including a newsletter offering giveaways and prizes.


## **UX**
The purpose of the website is to present the information about books and reading:
- How rewarding it is to read
- What to read
- Diversity of books
- Where books can take you

I felt it important to make sure that the design was clean and simple, just like a good book, the content is the star. 
It must be easy to navigate across all formats, be inviting and encourage the user to return to the site for information on new releases/reviews. 
It also needed to reflect my daughter’s personality and show how books and reading have influenced her and have that enthusiasm rub off on the user.


## **User Stories**
- As a reader, what do you recommend for me to read next?
- As a child, I want someone my own age to offer their opinion on this book.
- As a parent/teacher, I want something that will engage my child/class and keep them interested from the first word to the last.
- Where can I find out more?
- Can I buy the book?


## **Features**

### **Existing Features**
*Note: This project has changed in appearance since the conception of the [original wireframes]().  
Changes were made and [new wireframes]() were created to streamline the project and reduce the risk of over populating the site. 
As the project came together, minor changes were made to the design to aid with the aesthetics of the layout.*

- A ‘Favourites’ section highlights some of Megan’s favourite books with a review available and a link to buy should the user feel that want to read this particular book.
- A ‘Coming Soon’ section gives the user information on what Megan is currently reading. A quote from the author enhances the section and build expectation.

### **Gallery**

## **Technologies Used**

### **HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language)**
- [Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML)](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) is the standard mark-up language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. - Wikipedia 

### **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**
- [Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a mark-up language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. - Wikipedia


### **Bootstrap**
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a free and open source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. - Wikipedia


### **GitHub**
- [GitHub](https://github.com/), is a United States-based global company that provides hosting for software development version control using Git. - Wikipedia

### **Gitpod**
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/), is open-source IDE (Integrated Development Environment) based on Eclipse Theia.  It is used to create, modify, and save code.

### **Git** 
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. - Wikipedia
 
### **Web Development Tools** 
- [Web development tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) (often called dev-tools) allow web developers to test and debug their code. They are different from website builders and integrated development environments (IDEs) in that they do not assist in the direct creation of a webpage, rather they are tools used for testing the user interface of a website or web application. - Wikipedia

### **W3C Validation**
- [Mark-up Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) is a validator by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that allows Internet users to check HTML and XHTML documents for well-formed mark-up. Mark-up validation is an important step towards ensuring the technical quality of web pages. – Wikipedia


## **Testing**

Each file was tested on multipe viewing platforms.  Chrome developer tools was used extensively and I took advantage of the ability to swap devices to see how each layout would look on different platforms.  
All links responded and loaded within an accepatble time frame apart from IE where loading times were slower than expected and would result in a negative experience for the user. 
Taking advantage of cross platform capability within my household and family members, I was able to test my project on a variety of Android, Apple and Windows applictions with repeated success.  
I did not test this project on Opera due to issues installing the browser.
Only iPhone5/SE had difficulty displying full screen width without overflow. This was however, limited to the navbar overlapping the jumbotron and obscuring the callout, and resolved by altering the displayed text.
The site looks most appealing on mobile devices and iPad, with the iPad display being particularly attractive.  

*Please see the [testing spreadsheet](/../../testing/testing-results.jpg) in conjunction with the following results.*

### **Modals**
- Jumbotron Modals open when requested.  At present, the information requested is not collected and clicking the sign-up(submit) button returns the user to the index.html/reviews.html respectively.
- Review modals open for all six books when requested to do so and display the appropriate review and images.  Clicking on the ‘x’ or ‘close’ button, returns the user to the reviews section.

### **Contact**
- The contact form collects the user’s information.  At present, the form is not connected to any external server and the information requested is not collected.  Completing the form and submitting returns the user to the top of the contact page. 

### **Video/Images**
- Videos display responsively, play when requested and audio is functional.
- On mobile and tablet devices, the videos respond to the gyroscope function of the device.
